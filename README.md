## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
<img width="520" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98793962/170901315-04ee43b8-02ee-46d9-bc16-1276ff178b55.png">
1.  Sccording to our results, ground_clearance, vehicle_length, and intercept have are statistically 
unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words the vehicle 
length and ground clearance  have a significant impact on MPG.

2. Assuming our significance level is 0.05%, the p-value for this model, 5.35e-11 = 5.35 x 10-11 = 0.0000000000535, is much smaller than the assumed significance level, thus indicating that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indcates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

3. Since the linear model essentially has an r-squared value of 0.7149, meaning that around 71% of variancy can essentially be explained by our model.  All mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Essentially, this model does predict mpg of MeChaCar prototypes effectively.
